I've renamed my EVE CREST tool from Prest to [Preston](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Preston/).

---

And it's now version `2.0.0`.

For years, I've used the [eveapi](https://github.com/ntt/eveapi) library for accessing EVE's XML API. Today, I [added that capability](https://git.celeodor.com/Celeo/Preston/commit/2284b0a5adbcfa96fd8b102c36b4ce85eafb549a) to Preston.

It's rough, and eveapi's syntax is better - I would still use eveapi for apps in production right now.
